### Detail:
 * Kotlin
 * Coroutines
 * Mvvm
 * Clean Architecture
 * Reactive programming by Flow
 * Jetpack compose
 * Unit-test (JUnit, Coroutine-test, Turbine)
 * Ktor-client


In this project, "MVVM" architecture and clean architecture and domain, data, and presentation layers are used. "Jetpack compose" has been used for UI design, which allows better handling of UI status. To search character by character, a separate job is used in the coroutine, which performs the search operation with a delay of 500ms, and also the Reactive programming feature is handled using flow. For the "viewModel" and  "usescase" classes, unit tests have been written using "coroutine test" and "turbine" libraries, the "turbine" is used to test the flow, and finally, the "Ktor-client" library is used to communicate with the server.
